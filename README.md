# GARCH-modeling

In this repository you can find some basic code in which I conduct some volatility modeling using a GARCH(1,1) model on the _ProShares Short Dow30_. I look at the ACFs, the volatility clustering and the standardised residual distribution, among other metrics, to assess performance. In general, this basic GARCH model tends to underpredict volatility, as seen by the residual distribution having mean -1.
